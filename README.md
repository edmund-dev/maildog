## 👋 Hey, why building this?

Since I bought my first domain, I am always tempted to use it as my email address.
However, as I am not receiving many emails a day, hosting my mail server or paying for an email hosting service either make it too complicated or costs too much.
All I want is simply a service forwarding emails to one single place.

I have been happily using [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) for years.
As they changed pricing last year, I started looking for a replacement but options are relatively limited.

After all, I open-sourced maildog and is looking for a community that shares the same needs as me.
The project aims to offer an extensible email forwarding solution with minimal maintenance and operational cost.

## ☁️ How it works?
